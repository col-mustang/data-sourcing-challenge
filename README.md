# Module 6 Challenge: Data-Sourcing

## Overview
Showcasing Pandas and Python programming skills, the challenge gathers data from two apis using api keys and merges the data into a Pandas dataframe. Using Pandas properties and methods, the challenge transforms the data and then exports the data to csv.
